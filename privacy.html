                        The Don’t Forget The Eighties websites are hosted in the
                        United Kingdom, and we may use service providers in the
                        United Kingdom and elsewhere to process personal
                        information on our behalf. If you use the Don’t Forget
                        The Eighties website outside the United Kingdom, please
                        note that your personal data may be transferred outside
                        of your home jurisdiction to the United Kingdom and to
                        other jurisdictions where our affiliates and service
                        providers are located. Some of these jurisdictions may
                        not have equivalent data protection laws as the United

                        your personal data may be transferred to the United
                        Kingdom and other jurisdictions, as explained in this

                    <p>
                        The security of your information is important to us,
                        including, but not limited to, the personal information
                        collected via the Don’t Forget The Eighties website and
                        services. We use reasonable security measures to protect
                        against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal
                        information under our control, both during the
                        transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but
                        is not limited to, the use of firewalls and encryption.
                        Although we make good faith efforts to maintain the
                        security of such personal information, no method of
                        transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
                        storage, is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that it
                        will remain free from unauthorised access, use,
                        disclosure, or alteration. Further, while we work hard
                        to ensure the integrity and security of our network and
                        systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures
                        will prevent “hackers” or other unauthorised persons
                        from illegally accessing or obtaining this information.

                    <p>
                        If we learn of a security breach involving your personal
                        information, we may attempt to notify you electronically
                        so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By
                        using the Don’t Forget The Eighties website or providing
                        personal information to us, you agree that we can
                        communicate with you electronically regarding security,
                        privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use
                        of the Don’t Forget The Eighties website. If a security
                        systems breach occurs, we may post a notice on our
                        homepage (dft80s.band) or elsewhere on the Don’t Forget
                        The Eighties website and may send an email to you at the
                        email address you have provided to us. Depending on
                        where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
                        notice of a security breach, involving your personal
                        information, in writing.

                        In addition, we use Google Analytics to analyse our
                        users’ use of the Don’t Forget The Eighties website.
                        Google Analytics is currently on Don’t Forget The

                        decisions. Ultimately, Google, as a third party,

                    <p><strong>11. Third-Party Ad Networks</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We may use third parties such as network advertisers to
                        assist us in displaying advertisements on third party
                        websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising
                        campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that
                        display advertisements based on your visits to our
                        Website as well as other websites. This enables us, and
                        these third parties, to target advertisements by
                        displaying ads for products and services in which you
                        might be interested. Third party ad network providers,
                        advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement
                        services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons
                        (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other
                        technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads
                        and to personalise advertising content to you. These
                        third party cookies and other technologies are governed
                        by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this
                        one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with
                        information about your usage of our Websites, as well as
                        aggregate information about visitors to our Website.

                    <p>
                        You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks,
                        including those operated by members of the Network
                        Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital
                        Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information
                        regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members,
                        and your choices regarding having this information used
                        by these companies, including how to opt-out of
                        third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members,
                        please visit their respective websites:

                    <p>
                        Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member
                        networks (many of which will be the same) only means
                        that those members no longer will deliver targeted
                        content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no
                        longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site
                        or other websites. You may continue to receive
                        advertisements, for example, based on the particular
                        website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are
                        configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out
                        page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a
                        different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or
                        DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional
                        information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites
                        accessible by the above links.

                    <p>
                        We may occasionally update this privacy policy. If we

                        the privacy policy. Before making any update that would

                        our use or disclosure of personal information collected
                        prior to the update, we will provide prior notice of the
                        update by posting notice on our website at the top or
                        bottom of the then-current privacy policy. We encourage
                        you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay
                        informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of
                        personal information. Your continued use of our websites
                        constitutes your agreement to our then-current privacy
                        policy.
