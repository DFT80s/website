                    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        A cookie is a string of information that a website
                        stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
                        browser provides to the website each time the visitor
                        returns. Most major websites use cookies. Because the
                        browser provides this cookie information to the website
                        at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that
                        allows a website to “recognize” a browser when it
                        returns to the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies store information about your activities on a
                        website or other platform. For example, cookies can
                        store your session information for easy sign-in to a
                        website or other platform you have previously visited.
                        They enable us to make your use of the Don’t Forget The
                        Eighties website more enjoyable and to improve the
                        functionality of the service.

                    <p><strong>Clear GIFs</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) are used in
                        combination with cookies to help website operators
                        understand how visitors interact with their websites. A
                        clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic image
                        (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a website.
                        The use of a clear GIF allows the website to measure the
                        actions of the visitor opening the page that contains
                        the clear GIF. It makes it easier to follow and record
                        the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path
                        of pages visited at a website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clear GIFs, which can be embedded in web pages, videos,
                        or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types
                        of information from your browser, check whether you have
                        viewed a particular web page or email message, and
                        determine, among other things, the time and date on
                        which you viewed the Clear GIF, the IP address of your
                        computer, and the URL of the web page from which the
                        Clear GIF was viewed.
